## Introduction

There are many things that I have learned and improved throughout the last 12 weeks. Whether it is Agile Methodology in regards to planning or learning how to create a backend to hold data for a website. Here are 5 of the most important things that I have learned over these last 12 weeks.

### Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology is a project management technique that breaks a project up into different parts usually known as "Sprints", and allows for the user to reflect and review on each part/sprint to find out improvements and what they should do different next time or sprint.

#### How did this help?

Agile Methdology helped me to plan and organize my projects in a way that allowed me to improve and reflect after each section, but also not feel "lost" while executing certain parts of the project.

#### Some things we did included
