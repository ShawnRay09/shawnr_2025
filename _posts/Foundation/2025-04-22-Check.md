## Big Idea 1: Creative Development

- **1.1 Collaboration**  
  Working together improves problem-solving and program design.

- **1.2 Program Function and Purpose**  
  Programs are written to solve problems, express creativity, or perform tasks.

- **1.3 Program Design and Development**  
  Plan before coding: pseudocode, design steps, and test cases matter.

- **1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors**  
  Debugging is key — spot, fix, and explain errors in logic or syntax.

---

## Big Idea 2: Data

- **2.1 Binary Numbers**  
  All digital data is stored using 0s and 1s — binary is the base of computing.

- **2.2 Data Compression**  
  Reduce file size while preserving information (lossless vs lossy).

- **2.3 Extracting Information from Data**  
  Use patterns, filtering, and visualizations to gain insight.

- **2.4 Using Programs with Data**  
  Programs can process and transform data sets to reveal meaning.

- **2.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns**  
  Consider privacy, security, and bias in how data is used.

---

## Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming

- **3.1 Variables and Assignments**  
  Store data using variables that can change over time.

- **3.2 Data Abstraction**  
  Use lists or other structures to manage related data efficiently.

- **3.3 Mathematical Expressions**  
  Use math operators to process data and logic.

- **3.4 Strings**  
  Strings are sequences of characters — they can be split, combined, and more.

- **3.5 Boolean Expressions**  
  Use `true`/`false` logic to make decisions.

- **3.6 Conditionals**  
  If/else logic lets programs choose between actions.

- **3.7 Iteration**  
  Loops (like `for` and `while`) repeat actions to simplify code.

- **3.8-3.9 Lists**  
  Store multiple values in one place; manipulate them efficiently.

- **3.10-3.11 Traversing Lists**  
  Use loops to access and change list values.

- **3.12 Calling Procedures**  
  Run a set of instructions by calling a defined procedure or function.

- **3.13 Developing Procedures**  
  Write reusable code blocks to organize and simplify tasks.

- **3.14 Libraries**  
  Use external code to save time and reduce errors.

- **3.15-3.16 Simulations**  
  Imitate real-world systems for testing and analysis.

- **3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency**  
  Measure how fast or efficient your algorithm is.

- **3.18 Undecidable Problems**  
  Some problems can’t be solved by any algorithm — they’re undecidable.

---

## Big Idea 4: Computing Systems and Networks

- **4.1 The Internet**  
  A network of networks — enables global communication.

- **4.2 Fault Tolerance**  
  Internet systems can reroute data to handle errors or failures.

---

##  Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing

- **5.1 Computing Innovations**  
  Tech changes the world — socially, ethically, and practically.

- **5.2 Effects of Computing**  
  Includes both positive and negative impacts on society and individuals.

- **5.3 Crowdsourcing**  
  Gather data or solve problems by tapping into large groups of people.

- **5.4 Legal and Ethical Concerns**  
  Think about ownership, security, and equity in digital innovations.

- **5.5 Safe Computing**  
  Protect data with passwords, encryption, and smart digital habits.

- **5.6 Cybersecurity**  
  Understand threats like viruses and strategies like firewalls.

## Plan of Study

### 1. **Procedure Mastery**
- Topics: Developing Procedures (3.13), Calling Procedures (3.12), Libraries (3.14)
- Actions:
  - Write multiple functions from scratch
  - Refactor an old project to use more custom procedures
  - Practice importing and using `math`, `random`, and `datetime` libraries

### 2. **Algorithm & Logic Precision**
- Topics: Algorithmic Efficiency (3.17), Binary Numbers (2.1), Boolean & Nested Conditionals
- Actions:
  - Study sorting/searching concepts (linear vs binary)
  - Solve logic puzzles using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
  - Break down time complexity in one of my Python projects

### 3. **Debugging Practice**
- Topic: Identifying and Correcting Errors (1.4)
- Actions:
  - Analyze code snippets with errors (intentional bugs)
  - Build a short buggy program and fix it line-by-line
  - Peer review or swap code for external debugging

---

## Targeted Practice Tasks

- [ ] Write a recursive function and explain the base case
- [ ] Create a list-based project (like a leaderboard or to-do app)
- [ ] Simulate a real-world process using iteration & conditionals (e.g., vending machine, dice game)
- [ ] Practice decoding binary manually, then write a converter
- [ ] Take random CSP question sets (Quizizz, AP Classroom)

---

## Creative Challenges (Apply What You Know)

- **String Remix**: Build a string editor that lets users input text and apply transformations (reverse, capitalize, replace).
- **Binary Guessing Game**: Code a game where users guess the decimal value of a binary number.
- **Algorithm Race**: Write two sorting algorithms, time them, and visualize results.
- **“Bug Hunter” Blog Post**: Document a debugging process in detail — what went wrong, how you diagnosed it, what you learned.
- **CS + You**: Visualize how you use algorithms or data daily (recommendations, search, GPS, etc.).

## Final Strategy Notes

- Focus most on sections I haven’t attempted (3.13, 3.14, 3.2, 1.3)
- Use active learning: coding, drawing, teaching
- Track progress weekly in a Google Doc or journal
- Schedule full-length AP practice test after completing the study blocks
