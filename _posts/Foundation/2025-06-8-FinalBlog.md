# Final Blog - CSP Projects Recap

As the year wraps up, hereâ€™s a brief look at some of the projects I worked on in CSP and what made each one unique and valuable in its own way.

---

## ðŸ§  Jupyter  
Jupyter was our first major project â€” a school-focused platform that gave students a space to discuss academic topics. It featured helpful tools like a dictionary and a derivative calculator to support collaborative learning.

### Homepage  
<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jupyterhome.png" alt="Jupyter Homepage" style="width: 100%; max-width: 480px; height: auto; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;" />
</p>

### My Feature: Real-Time Timer  
<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jupytertimer.png" alt="Jupyter Timer Feature" style="width: 100%; max-width: 480px; height: auto; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;" />
</p>

One feature I personally worked on was a **real-time timer**. During this project, I was just beginning to learn JavaScript, so I spent a lot of time experimenting and tinkering to get it working correctly. It was a great intro to using intervals, DOM manipulation, and state updates.

## ðŸŒŠ Neptune  
Neptune was like Jupyter, but better. It was a much more advanced, interactive fullstack platform. It included real-time chat, class selection, schedule viewing, and more.

### Homepage  
<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/neptunehome.png" alt="Neptune Homepage" style="width: 100%; max-width: 480px; height: auto; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;" />
</p>

### My Feature: Choose Your Classes  
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/neptuneclasses.png" alt="Neptune Classes Feature" style="flex: 1 1 360px; max-width: 360px; height: auto; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/neptuneschedule.png" alt="Neptune Schedule View" style="flex: 1 1 360px; max-width: 360px; height: auto; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;" />
</div>

I worked on the **class selection feature**, where users could choose their classes, and those choices were saved to a backend users table. The selected schedule would dynamically display for each user. I also re-used the **real-time timer** I built for Jupyter and integrated it here with a more polished UI.

### Feature Demo Video

## ðŸš— Parking Meter Predictor  
This project attempted to predict the availability of parking meters based on collected data. Though the end result wasnâ€™t fully what we wanted, it was a valuable lesson in dealing with real-world limitations and uncertainty in predictions.

### Homepage  
<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/smartparkhome.png" alt="Parking Predictor Homepage" style="width: 100%; max-width: 480px; height: auto; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;" />
</p>

### My Contribution: Styling  
<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/smartparkstyle.png" alt="Parking Page Styling" style="width: 100%; max-width: 480px; height: auto; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;" />
</p>

I was in charge of **styling the homepage and other pages**. I worked on layout, color schemes, spacing, and responsiveness to create a clean and user-friendly interface across the project.

## ðŸ“š Team Teach Lesson Layouts  
For our final project, we created interactive lesson layouts to support team-teaching. These layouts included fun and engaging features like flashcards, a quiz game, and more.

### Homepage  
<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/lessonhome.png" alt="Lesson Layout Homepage" style="width: 100%; max-width: 480px; height: auto; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;" />
</p>

### My Features: Popcorn Hack + Feedback + Pitch  
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; gap: 10px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/lessonhack.png" alt="Popcorn Hack Run Code Feature" style="flex: 1 1 360px; max-width: 360px; height: auto; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/lessonfeedback.png" alt="Feedback Feature" style="flex: 1 1 360px; max-width: 360px; height: auto; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;" />
</div>

I worked on the **Popcorn Hack "Run Code" feature**, which allows teachers to input questions that students answer by typing code or text. The code can run and show output, and the responses are saved to **local storage**. I also developed a **feedback feature** to collect user reflections and suggestions, and contributed to the **project pitch video**.

### Pitch Video

Each of these projects helped me grow â€” from learning JavaScript basics to building fullstack features and improving UI/UX design. Iâ€™m proud of how far weâ€™ve come this year!
