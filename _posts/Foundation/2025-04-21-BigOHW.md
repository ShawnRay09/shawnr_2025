```python
# O(1) Time Complexity:
# Accessing an element directly in an array/list by its index is a great example of constant time complexity:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
element = my_list[2]
```

```python
# O(log n) Time Complexity:
# Binary search is an ideal example for logarithmic complexity:
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

```python
# O(n) Time Complexity:
# A linear search through a list is the simplest example:
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for index, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value == target:
            return index
    return -1
```

```python
# O(nÂ²) Time Complexity:
# \Nested loops that iterate over a 2D matrix represent quadratic complexity:
def print_pairs(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)):
            print(f"({arr[i]}, {arr[j]})")
```
