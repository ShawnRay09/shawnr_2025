# Interest in Prism

One cool site I noticed during N@TM was Prism:

Prism is an AI-powered social media platform that emphasizes user connections and creativity. It offers several features designed to enhance user experience. These include:​

- Interest-Based Leaderboards: These leaderboards show the top interests among users, this is also shown on the users feed and creates a sense of community. This feature accomplishes their goal of bringing users together through their interests.​
- Chatrooms: Prism provides chatrooms for real-time conversations, allowing users to connect instantly and build relationships based on common interests.​
- Polls: The platform includes interactive polls, allowing users to participate in community discussions and express their opinions on various topics.​

Ultimately, the grows I told them were: "I really like the UI and the usefulness of the features you guys have created. I think that this project is super unique and unlike all of the other ones so I applaud you guys for that."

On the other hand, some suggestions I had, which I told them about were:

- "One thing I would improve is that I think you guys could change the user interface to be more tailored to your sites theme."

Overall, Prism's project is really cool and they have solid work accomplished. 

## Why?

I really liked Prism's project because like ours, I really saw the purpose of it and valued it. It is extremely customizable to the user's taste and almost revolves around that which separates this website from the rest.

# Self-Grade Assessment

| Topic                     | Rating  | Strengths/Weaknesses  | Reasoning/Comments                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Planning**        | 0.2/0.2            | Strength              | I believe I am very good at planning, I created most of the issues and designated roles according to strengths and weaknesses of my team. I did things early and tried to be as creative as possible whilst still thinking realistically time-wise. |
| **Creativity**    | 0.07/0.1            | Weakness              | Though my feature had a lot of depth to it, it is not the most creative feature as there are other apps with similar features like saturn, reminders, and more. |
| **Functionality**    | 0.27/0.3            | Strength              | Works very well and as intended, user functionality is well however, some parts could be change to be more user friendly. |
| **Knowledge**        | 0.26/0.3            | Weakness              | Key Terms and Phrases are known, however some MCQ questions were missed off of shallow knowledge. |
| **Collaboration & Feedback** | 0.1/0.1           | Strength              | I value feedback and collaboration, and I use them to improve my coding skills and approach. I also gave lots of feedback to a variety of groups at N@TM and often called my group outside of class to discuss our website plans. |
| **Total** | 0.9/1 | | I believe I did fairly well with planning, and even though I believed our creativity was slightly lacking, I believe that it has drastically improved over the last 12 weeks. Things like functionality can be fixed over time and if we had a couple more weeks to tweak this project, all of these little minor fixes would be fixed. Knowledge can be improved by studying, reading blogs, and more, and finally collaboration and feedback have never been better. I think this project was amazing for collaboration and feedback and especially with the Agile Methology implementation. |
