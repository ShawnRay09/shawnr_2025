# Shawn.py Postman API Testing

I created a Shawn.py file to do testing and inputted this code into the file. I set an endpoint of /api/shawn that returns information about me from the backend.

# Neptune with Postman API

I put this code in our main.py file in our Neptune_backend. It sets an endpoint at api/classes and allows that endpoint to handle GET requests. Whenever
a GET request is sent to the endpoint, it will return a list full of different classes that have been defined.
