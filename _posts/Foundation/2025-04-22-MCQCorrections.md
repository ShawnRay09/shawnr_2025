I chose 6 bits, but that only gives me 64 unique sequences, which isn’t enough for up to 100 items. I need to use at least 7 bits because \(2^7 = 128\), which covers the entire range.

I chose the option about monitoring chats with software, but that doesn’t involve input from many users. I should have picked the one where players endorse each other, since that’s a true example of crowdsourcing.

I picked the answer that said any problem can be solved algorithmically, but that’s not true. I should’ve remembered that some problems can’t be solved by any algorithm at all, which makes option D the correct choice.

What I did wrong:
I chose answer D, which describes asymmetric encryption using two keys, instead of symmetric encryption.

What I can fix:
I should remember that symmetric encryption uses a single secret key for both encryption and decryption, as stated in answer A.

I mistakenly used the APPEND function to place the last element at the end of the list instead of moving it to the beginning. To fix this, I'll use the INSERT function to correctly position the last element at the start.

I wrongly included both RETURN statements, causing the procedure to terminate prematurely. To fix this, I'll remove Line 8 and Line 15 to ensure the flow executes properly.

In the code segment D, I incorrectly reversed the order of substring concatenation, which leads to a flipped output. To fix this, I'll swap the substring inputs so substring(oldStr, 1, n - 1) appears first
