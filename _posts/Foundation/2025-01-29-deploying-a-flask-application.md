## Introduction

To deploy a flask application it involves many processes and configurations.

## Key Terms

- DNS (Domain Name System): A system that translates human-readable domain names (like nighthawkcodingsociety.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other.
- Subdomain: A domain that is part of a larger domain, such as flask2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com.
- Reverse Proxy (Nginx): A server that forwards requests to a backend server (in this case, your Flask app) and returns the response to the client.
- SSL (Secure Socket Layer): A protocol for securing data between a server and a client, typically resulting in an HTTPS URL.
- Docker: A platform used for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers, ensuring consistency across environments.
- AWS EC2: A web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, used for deploying your backend server.
