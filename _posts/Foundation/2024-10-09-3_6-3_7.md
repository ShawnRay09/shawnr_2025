```python
#Homework Hack for 3.6
```


```python
def assess_numbers(a, b):
    if a == b:
        print("The two numbers are identical.")
    elif a > b:
        print(f"{a} is the greater number.")
    else:
        print(f"{b} is the greater number.")

first_number = float(input("Please enter the first number: "))
second_number = float(input("Please enter the second number: "))

assess_numbers(first_number, second_number)

```

    Please enter the first number:  1
    Please enter the second number:  1


    The two numbers are identical.



```python
def assess_numbers(a, b):
    if a == b:
        print("The two numbers are identical.")
    elif a > b:
        print(f"{a} is the greater number.")
    else:
        print(f"{b} is the greater number.")

first_number = float(input("Please enter the first number: "))
second_number = float(input("Please enter the second number: "))

assess_numbers(first_number, second_number)

```

    Please enter the first number:  1
    Please enter the second number:  2


    2.0 is the greater number.

```python
#Python delivery speed
def calculate_shipping(weight, delivery_speed):
    if weight <= 5:  # Weight in pounds
        if delivery_speed == "standard":
            cost = 5.00
        elif delivery_speed == "express":
            cost = 10.00
        else:
            cost = "Invalid delivery speed."
    elif weight <= 20:
        if delivery_speed == "standard":
            cost = 10.00
        elif delivery_speed == "express":
            cost = 20.00
        else:
            cost = "Invalid delivery speed."
    else:
        if delivery_speed == "standard":
            cost = 20.00
        elif delivery_speed == "express":
            cost = 40.00
        else:
            cost = "Invalid delivery speed."
    
    return cost

weight = float(input("Enter the weight of the package (in pounds): "))
speed = input("Choose delivery speed (standard/express): ")
shipping_cost = calculate_shipping(weight, speed)
print(f"Shipping cost: {shipping_cost}")

```

    Enter the weight of the package (in pounds):  10
    Choose delivery speed (standard/express):  standard


    Shipping cost: 10.0



```python
