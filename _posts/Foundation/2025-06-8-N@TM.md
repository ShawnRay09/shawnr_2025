| This site is very thoughtful and has many practical functions. Some improvements include improving the UI to flow better.            | Anvay                                        |
| Great idea! I like how you can link several aspects of school together all in one place.                                             | Mrs. Hightower                               |
| I love how the site looks, the animations and stars really help make it fun and interesting. The features are interactive and fun.   | Joanna Hu                                    |
| I love how this site resembles Saturn. It's similar but better due to the Greek theme. Consider using a shared stylesheet.           | Yash Parikh                                  |
| I have found this project extremely helpful. The UI is very good and user experience is great. Consider adding a phone app.          | Mihir Bapat                                  |
| Very creative website with a lot of useful applications.                                                                             | Ikshit, Amrit, Aditya, Saharsh - Bay Area    |
| I like how it resembles a scheduling app. The Greek gods theme is very cool.                                                         | Yuva                                         |
