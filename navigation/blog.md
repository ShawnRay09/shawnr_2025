<h1><strong>About the Game</strong></h1>

Valorant is a 5v5 shooter with different agents and abilities. There are two sides, attackers and defenders. Attackers need to plant a bomb into a site and defenders need to stop them, or defuse the bomb. You can buy different guns and abilities, and first to 13 rounds wins. You also switch sides after 13 rounds.

I absolutely hate this game from the bottom of my heart. However, I still torture myself by playing it. You might ask why, and the simple answer is that I am subject to the Valorant Rabbit Hole. Now you might be asking, "What could that possibly be?" Well the answer is that I am addicted and can't stop playing a game every weekend. Everytime I queue into a game, I get the worst teammates ever and sometimes I wonder if they have working brains (Just kidding kind of). The point I am trying to get at is that sometimes Valorant is just a very frustrating game, but don't get me wrong it can be fun at sometimes, but at others, not so much.

Sometimes I surprisingly like the game. It might surprise you, but it is actually fun sometimes. Whenever this happens it feels amazing and I actually have fun. This happens once in a blue moon, but this usually ends in a win which obviously feels good. I honestly like playing it with my friends and have a good time. I also have a good time when I am actually doing good and ranking up in the game.
